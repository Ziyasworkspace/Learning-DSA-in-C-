This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice using C++.
I am learning DSA step by step and pushing my daily practice code here to track my progress and improve problem-solving skills.

The focus is on logic building, clear understanding, and consistent practice rather than shortcuts.

What I’m Practicing

Basic problem solving

Time & space complexity awareness

Core data structures

Algorithmic thinking

Topics Covered (will grow over time)

Basics (loops, conditions, patterns)

Arrays

Strings

Searching & Sorting

Recursion

Linked List

Stack & Queue

Trees

Graphs

Dynamic Programming (later)

Language Used

C++

 Learning Approach

Solve 2–3 problems daily

Understand logic before coding

Write clean and readable code

Commit code regularly to GitHub

 Current Status

Beginner level

Actively learning and updating this repository

 Goal

To build strong fundamentals in DSA and improve logical thinking for:

Competitive programming

Technical interviews

Core computer science understanding

🔄 Updates

This repository will be updated regularly as I learn new concepts and solve more problems.# Learning-DSA-in-C-
